# Ideas

- Research the external API for your application (such as Google Maps, Forecast.io, Ombd, Shakeitspeare, etc)
- Register for an API key
- Identify sample code to test (look for sample api calls to try)
- Create base Node HTTP requests to fetch/GET data
- Test the validity of the data for your project
