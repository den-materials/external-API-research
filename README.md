# External API Research

For Project 2, you will need to use a 3rd Party Web API to enrich the functionality of your app.  Today, you will research one or two APIs that you think will be helpful, and get to a solid `Hello World` state with at least one API.

This lab will be pretty free-form, but we are expecting you to complete the following by the end of tonight.

- Research the external API for your application (such as Google Maps, Forecast.io, Omdb, Shakeitspeare, etc)
- Register for an API key
- Identify sample code to test (look for sample api calls to try)
- If there is a tutorial for your API, you should go through it.  If there is not, you should read all the documentation and spend at least an hour making practice requests.
- Test your requests in the browser
- Test your requests with Postman
- Create base Node HTTP requests to fetch/GET data
- Test the validity of the data for your project, using Mocha and Chai (Is this what you want?  Is it *everything* you want?)

### Challenge

For those lucky few who got a headstart on this, or found one of the ten easy APIs in existence, if your API is in a good state, start thinking about what other 3rd Party API may be helpful for your project.

### Reference

- For anyone who completed the [AJAX and Forms Lab](https://github.com/den-materials/forms-and-ajax-lab), you have completed a lot of this work already.  See if you can take your API interaction to the next level!
- The [TDD and Mocha Class](https://github.com/den-materials/tdd-and-mocha) will be helpful for building any tests.
- Not sure which API to choose?  Check out the [Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) or the [Public APIs Directory](http://www.publicapis.com/).
- Looking to test your API on the front end?  Have a look at [this article](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2013/testing-frontend-javascript-code-using-mocha-chai-and-sinon/).
  - **TLDR: You can use jQuery for an AJAX request and include mocha and chai the same way you include jQuery with a `<script>` tag.**
